# e-commerce-payment-processor-scrapper

This project is designed to **scrape payment processor details** and their **evidence snippets** from e-commerce websites.
It works in two major steps:

---

## üöÄ Workflow

### **Step 1 ‚Äì Website Accessibility Check**

* Input: a **CSV file** containing website URLs.
* The script checks if each website is accessible by sending a request with a **25‚Äì30s timeout**.
* Output:

  * A **copy of the input file** with an additional column `Accessibility` (`Accessible` / `Not Accessible`).
  * A **checkpoint.json** file that records processing progress.

Example of `checkpoint.json`:

```json
{
  "input_file": "input/Mountain Pacific AK_HI Shop data scrape_09-23-2025_14k.csv",
  "output_folder": "output/Mountain Pacific AK_HI Shop data scrape_09-23-2025_14k",
  "output_file": "output/Mountain Pacific AK_HI Shop data scrape_09-23-2025_14k/Mountain Pacific AK_HI Shop data scrape_09-23-2025_14k.csv",
  "column_name": "track-visit-website href",
  "total_rows": 6448,
  "last_processed_index": 6447,
  "processed_rows": 6448,
  "status": "completed",
  "started_at": "2025-09-23T09:11:41Z",
  "updated_at": "2025-09-24T14:05:34Z",
  "completed_at": "2025-09-23T12:27:31Z",
  "duration_minutes": 195.83
}
```

‚úÖ The checkpoint system ensures that if the process is interrupted (due to errors or large file size), the script can resume from the last processed index.

### **Step 2 ‚Äì Scraping Payment Processors**

* Input: the **Accessible websites** identified in Step 1.

* For each site:

  1. Detect if a **shopping cart** exists.
  2. If a cart is available, **scrape payment processors** used by the site.

     * **HTML scraping**: extracting processor names from the site.
     * **Image-to-text scraping**: handling cases where payment processor logos are shown as images.

* Output:

  * Extended CSV file with additional columns:

    * `Cart Available` (Yes/No)
    * `Payment Processors` (list of detected processors)
    * `Evidence Snippet` (supporting snippet or OCR result)
